               The goal of Orbit is to let as
               many rocks pass as possible
               and not get hit. You can shoot by
               tapping on the screen. The orbit
               radius can be increased by swiping
               to the right and decreased by swiping
               left. But watch out, red rocks cannot
               be destroyed. Blue rocks have 2
               hitpoints, purple rocks 3!
               Each rock gives as many points
               as it has hitpoints when it reaches
               the end of the usiverse (screen).


         < This is an unfinished project, I'll work on it
           whenever I will find more time >
